### Patch Changes

- Registry metadata: these packages pointed at the private development
  monorepo, so each one's page on npm linked to a repository nobody outside
  could open. They now name the public repository and carry the `homepage` and
  `bugs` fields npm renders.
  
  A patch rather than nothing, because a manifest only reaches the registry with
  a new version.
